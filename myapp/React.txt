1 . Diffing -> In React, diffing refers to the process of comparing two versions of the Virtual DOM to determine what has changed, so that React can efficiently update the real DOM.

2 . Declarative UI

3 . Babel is a JavaScript compiler used in React projects to convert modern JavaScript (ES6+ and JSX) into older JavaScript that browsers can understand.

4 . npm is a tool to install and manage JavaScript packages — like a library installer for your code.
  
  . Vite is a tool that helps you build and run web apps quickly while you're coding and also prepares them for going live.

  . Bun is a new, super-fast tool that can do what both npm and Vite do, plus run your code — all in one.

Relation between index.html , main.jsx and app.jsx:
  index.html
  └── <div id="root"></div>     <-- Empty div

main.jsx
  └── ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
          .render(<App />)     <-- Injects <App /> into "root" div

App.jsx
  └── Your entire React UI     <-- This gets shown in browser


Regular function vs React component:
A React component is a special function that returns JSX and starts with a capital letter, so React knows to render it as UI, not run it like a regular function.

1 . camelCase – Used for variable and function names, starting with lowercase and capitalizing subsequent words (e.g., myVariableName).
2 . kebab-case – Used for file names and CSS class names, all lowercase with words separated by hyphens (e.g., my-component).
3 . snake_case – Used mainly in Python and APIs, all lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., my_variable_name).
4 . PascalCase – Used for React components and classes, with each word capitalized (e.g., MyComponent).


.You use ./ when you're importing files that are local to the current folder.
import './index.css'       // same folder
import '../App.css'        // parent folder
import './components/Nav'  // subfolder
